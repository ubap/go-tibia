## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start dev backend and dev frontend.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
